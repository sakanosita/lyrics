[Intro]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day

[Verse 1]
Shadows grew so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night (Ooh)
Far away from the city

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, hey-eeh-yeah-yeah

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, yeah-yeah
I wanna be with you night and day

[Verse 2]
The moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
Well, I can see them under the pine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But don't, woah no no, hesitate, la-di-dah
'Cause your love just won't wait
Hey-eeh-yeah-yeah!

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, ey-yeah!
I wanna be with you night and day
Woah, baby, oh baby, please!

[Saxophone solo]
Every day, yeah-eeh-yeah!
How I love, how I love ya-hah
(I love your way)
Oh, baby, please!

[Verse 3]
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la-di-dah!
'Cause your love just won't wait
Just won't wait

[Chorus 3]
Ooh, baby, I love your way
Every, every day-eeh-yay!
I wanna tell you I love your way
I wanna tell you how I love your little ways
I wanna be with you night and day
Every day in every way, yeah!

[Chorus repeat until fade-out]
(Ooh, baby, I love your way)

I wanna tell you how I, I wanna tell you how I love your little ways
(I wanna be with you night and day)
Bididiabididisapidadee-yeah

(Ooh baby, I love your way)
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
