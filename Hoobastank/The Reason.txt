[Verse 1]
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear


[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Post-Chorus]
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

[Break]
I'm not a perfect person

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you
