[Intro]
Jim Beanz, give it to me, oh baby I can't!

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool, girl, I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah


[Verse 2]
Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now, I'm sitting here, thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool (fool), girl, I know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post - Chorus]
Because it feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ah, I just can't go to sleep
'Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And I know that it's love because


[Chorus]
I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
